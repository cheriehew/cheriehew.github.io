    <p>During the spring of 2020, I lived in Washington, DC while interning with Special Olympics International. My main intern position was with the Organizational Excellence team. I was originally brought onto the team to gather, analyze, and release data from the annual census that the organization conducts with over 270 programs around the world. This data project was one of the first large-scale data projects that I participated in, and it gave me invaluable experience to bring back to college and to use in my future career. Throughout the internship my managers encouraged me to explore other departments within the organization to find other projects and fields to work with. One area that was very intriguing to me was the Athlete Leadership field. Athlete Leadership is key to the movement of Special Olympics because it allows athletes to contribute to leadership roles off of the sports field. I was able to engage with the Athlete Leadership team as a Coordinator from May-August of 2020. This role was very special to me because it not only gave me hands-on experience within a field that I am very passionate for, but it also gave me numerous relationships with athletes around the world that I am still able to keep in contact with today. I <del> enjoyed </del>loved my time with Special Olympics International, and hope to work closely with them again in the future.</p>
