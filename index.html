    <P> As a Freshmen at the University of Georgia, I joined Special Olympics at UGA as a general body member. I fell in love with the organization and decided to step into a leadership role as a committee member during my second semester. At the end of my first year, I joined the executive board as the director of Fundraising. I will be one of two Directors for the organization for the 2021-2022 academic year.</P>
    <P> After graduation, I plan on attending Law School to puruse my dream of become an adoption attorney for children with intellectual and physical disabilities. My previous experience with Special Olympics at UGA and my education as an HDFS major will help me to accomplish this goal. </P>
    <P> While at UGA I have participated in multiple clubs and organizations that will also help me achieve my goal of going to law school. During the academic year of 2020-2021, I was able to represent the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences as a Student Ambassador. This expereince taught me invaluable leadership and communication skills that will benefit me greatly as I continue my academic career. </P>
