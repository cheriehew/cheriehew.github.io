    <P> As a Freshmen at the University of Georgia, I joined Special Olympics at UGA as a general body member. I fell in love with the organization and decided to step into a leadership role as a committee member during my second semester. At the end of my first year, I joined the executive board as the director of Fundraising. I will be one of two Directors for the organization for the 2021-2022 academic year.</P>
    <P> After graduation, I plan on attending Law School to puruse my dream of become an adoption attorney for children with intellectual and physical disabilities. Earlier this semster I found out that there are only five lawyers in the state of Georgia that practice adoption law with the specialty of children with special needs. After learning this, I was encouraged to practice disablity law to bring representation to a field that is currently lacking personnel. My previous experience with Special Olympics at UGA and my education as an HDFS major will help me to accomplish this goal. </P>
    <P> While at UGA I have participated in multiple clubs and organizations that will also help me achieve my goal of going to law school. During the academic year of 2020-2021, I was able to represent the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences as a Student Ambassador. This expereince taught me invaluable leadership and communication skills that will benefit me greatly as I continue my academic career. </P>
